.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B buildvc
.RB [ -m

.RB [ -e ]
.RI [ changesfile_or_dir
.RI [ commentfile ]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbuildvc\fP tool adds a new changes entry to a SUSE \fB.changes\fP file.
The \fB-m\fP option can be used to directly specify the entry, if it is
not given an editor is started to interactively enter the new changes
entry. If a \fIcommentfile\fP is given, its content is used as template
for the new entry instead of an empty entry, whereas the \fB-e\fP option
suppresses the creation of an empty entry.

If no \fIchangesfile\fP is specified, \fBbuildvc\fP will search the current
directory for a file ending with \fB.changes\fP. If a directory is
specified instead of a changes will, it will be searched instead.
